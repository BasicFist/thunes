| **RL/Statistical Hybrid** | HFT (minute/tick) | 16-17% | High | PPO, A3C, LSTM |
| **Daily Trading** | EOD signals | 6-7% | Medium | DQN, basic RL |
| **Traditional (SMA)** | Daily | 4-5% | Low-Medium | Moving averages |

**THUNES Baseline**: Current SMA Crossover strategy (Phase 3) delivers ~4-5% annualized returns (testnet backtests). RL upgrade (Phase 16) should target 12-15% (conservative vs 16-17% benchmark given slippage).

### 4.3 RL Architecture Patterns

**Common Components**:
- **State representation**: OHLCV + orderbook depth + volatility regime
- **Action space**: {BUY, SELL, HOLD} or continuous position sizing [-1, +1]
- **Reward function**: Sharpe ratio, risk-adjusted PnL, or multi-objective (return + drawdown)
- **Algorithms**: PPO (stable), A3C (parallelizable), SAC (continuous actions)

**Production Challenges**:
- Training data quality (survivorship bias, look-ahead leaks)
- Overfitting to specific market regimes
- Reward hacking (e.g., maximizing turnover to inflate Sharpe)
