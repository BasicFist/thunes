# Disaster Recovery Drill - Execution Guide

**Date**: 2025-10-09
**Purpose**: Complete guide for executing Phase 13 pre-deployment DR drill
**Expected Duration**: 2.5 hours (30min prep + 2h drill)
**Deployment Impact**: 51% ‚Üí 72% readiness (makes deployment viable)

---

## Executive Summary

The Disaster Recovery (DR) drill is the **single remaining deployment blocker** for Phase 13. This guide provides a complete execution workflow from pre-flight checks through post-drill documentation.

**Why This Matters**:
- Current operational maturity: 60% (inadequate)
- Post-drill operational maturity: 85% (acceptable)
- Overall deployment readiness: 51% ‚Üí 72%
- **Without DR drill**: Cannot deploy safely (untested procedures)
- **With DR drill**: Ready for Phase 13 testnet deployment

---

## Prerequisites Checklist

Before starting, ensure you have:

- [ ] **2.5 hours** of uninterrupted time
- [ ] **Binance testnet** account with API keys configured

## Decision Matrix After Drill

### If All Tests Pass (4/4)

**Status**: ‚úÖ Ready for Phase 13 Deployment

**Deployment Readiness**: 72% (acceptable for testnet)

**Next Steps**:
1. Review pre-deployment checklist: `docs/PHASE-13-DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md`
2. Execute pre-deployment validation: `bash scripts/pre_deployment_validation.sh`
3. Follow deployment runbook: `docs/PHASE-13-DEPLOYMENT-RUNBOOK.md`
4. Deploy to Phase 13 testnet
5. Execute post-deployment verification: `bash scripts/post_deployment_verification.sh`

**Timeline**: Deploy within 24 hours (while procedures are fresh)

---

### If 3/4 Tests Pass

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Conditional Go (Review Required)

**Analysis Required**:
- Which test failed and why?
- Is failure due to procedure error or system bug?
- Can issue be fixed quickly (<2 hours)?
- Does failure block deployment or is it acceptable risk?

**Decision Path**:
- **Procedure error**: Fix documentation, re-run failed test
- **Minor system bug**: Document workaround, create Phase 14 ticket, deploy
- **Major system bug**: Fix code, re-run full drill, delay deployment

---

### If 2/4 or Fewer Tests Pass

**Status**: üî¥ No-Go (Delay Deployment)

**Required Actions**:
1. Analyze all failures systematically
2. Identify root causes (bugs vs procedure gaps)
3. Create prioritized fix list
4. Fix critical issues
5. Re-run complete drill
6. Do not deploy until 4/4 tests pass

**Escalation**: If multiple tests fail, this indicates systemic issues. Consider:
- Code review of risk manager and audit trail
- Additional integration testing
- Consultation with external reviewer
- Extended testing period before deployment

---

## Emergency Procedures During Drill

### If System Hangs or Freezes

```bash
# Terminal 1: Check process status
ps aux | grep python

# If process is running but unresponsive:
pkill -TERM -f paper_trader
# Wait 10 seconds
sleep 10

# If still running:
pkill -9 -f paper_trader

# Restart from known state
python src/live/paper_trader.py --symbol BTCUSDT --side BUY --amount 100 &
```

### If Telegram Alerts Stop Working

**Immediate Actions**:
1. Check internet connectivity: `ping api.telegram.org`
2. Verify bot token hasn't expired
3. Check Telegram bot status: `python scripts/verify_telegram.py`

**Workaround**: Continue drill using log monitoring only, document Telegram failure as action item.

### If Database Corruption Detected

```bash
# Check integrity
sqlite3 positions.db "PRAGMA integrity_check;"

# If corrupted, restore from backup (if exists)
cp positions.db.backup positions.db

# If no backup, reinitialize (data loss)
rm positions.db
python -c "from src.models.position import PositionTracker; pt = PositionTracker()"
```

**Critical**: Database corruption during drill is a major red flag. Do not deploy until root cause is identified and fixed.

### If Audit Trail Corruption Detected

```bash
# Validate all lines
python -c "
import json
with open('logs/audit_trail.jsonl') as f:
    for i, line in enumerate(f, 1):
        try:
            json.loads(line)
        except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
            print(f'Line {i} corrupted: {e}')
"

# If corruption found, this is CRITICAL
# Do not deploy until two-level locking is verified
grep -n "fcntl" src/risk/manager.py
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I run the drill on production?

**A**: ‚ùå NO. The drill includes intentional crashes (kill -9) and kill-switch toggling. Only run on testnet with no real funds at risk.

### Q: What if I don't have an open position?

**A**: You can skip Test 1 or create a small position first:
```bash
python src/live/paper_trader.py --symbol BTCUSDT --side BUY --amount 10
```

### Q: Can I automate the drill?

**A**: Partially. Steps 1-2 (kill-switch) can be automated, but human verification of Telegram alerts is required. Tests 3-4 (crash recovery, reconciliation) require judgment calls best made manually.

### Q: How often should we run this drill?

**A**:
- **Phase 13 (testnet)**: Monthly
- **Phase 14 (live)**: Weekly for first month, then bi-weekly
- **After incidents**: Within 48 hours to validate fixes

### Q: What if Telegram is down?

**A**: Continue drill using log monitoring only. Telegram failure doesn't invalidate other test results, but should be documented and investigated.
